# AI Code + Input Validator (Demo)

This demo shows how to build a small system where an AI-style tool:
1. Reads a Python code file,
2. Detects functions and expected inputs,
3. Executes those functions with a JSON payload,
4. Flags mismatches and suggests fixes.

## Contents
- `app.py` — Streamlit web UI: upload a `.py` file, pick a function, paste JSON, and run validation.
- `user_validator.py` — Sample validator with typical checks (name/age/email).
- `ai_code_validator.py` — CLI runner for the same sample.
- `requirements.txt` — Dependencies.

## Quick Start

### 1) Create and activate a virtualenv (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2) Install deps
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Run the web app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open the URL that appears (usually http://localhost:8501).

### 4) Try the sample
- Upload `user_validator.py` in the UI.
- Select `validate_user`.
- Paste JSON like:
```json
{"name": "Manish123", "age": 15, "email": "manish@@gmail"}
```
- Click **Run Validation**. You should see an INVALID result and a suggested fix.

### 5) Run the CLI demo (optional)
```bash
python ai_code_validator.py
```

## How It Works

- The app dynamically loads your Python file as a module, introspects functions, and shows their signatures.
- When you submit a JSON payload, the app calls the selected function with those parameters inside a try/except.
- If an exception is raised, the error message is parsed for common validation hints (e.g., "at least 18", "Invalid email format").
- A suggestion is generated by heuristics (you can replace this with LLM-powered reasoning later).

## Production Notes

- **Sandboxing:** In production, execute code in a Docker container or a restricted sandbox.
- **Multiple files/repo:** Walk the repo, load modules, and present a combined function list.
- **Language support:** Add similar runners for Node/Java/etc., and invoke via subprocess from the UI.
- **CI/CD integration:** Fail a build (or block a deployment) when invalid inputs are detected.
